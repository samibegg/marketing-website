For agencies: developing performance-based solicitations, defining meaningful Al performance metrics, evaluating vendor proposals and capabilities (including pre-award testing), and negotiating contract terms (data/IP rights, lock-in avoidance, transparency). For vendors: helping them understand and meet federal requirements, structure proposals effectively, and prepare for performance validation.

                   Many of these service areas are interconnected. For instance, an agency's Al strategy will inform its governance needs and identify high-impact use cases requiring risk management. Consultants can leverage these connections by offering bundled solutions or positioning themselves for follow-on work, moving from initial strategy or compliance engagements to broader implementation and optimization support.<sup>38</sup> While immediate demand may focus on reactive compliance activities driven by OMB deadlines, the long-term opportunity lies in partnering with agencies to proactively use Al for mission transformation and value creation, aligning with the administration's ultimate goals.

                    Engaging with an agency at this strategic level offers significant advantages for consulting firms. Helping to shape an agency's foundational Al strategy provides deep insights into its priorities, challenges, planned investments, and key stakeholders (like the CAIO).<sup>117</sup> This knowledge and the established relationship position the consulting firm favorably for subsequent opportunities related to implementing the strategy, providing ongoing governance support, assisting with procurements identified in the roadmap, or delivering specific Al solutions.

                    Effective Al relies fundamentally on access to high-quality, well-managed, and secure data. Recognizing this, the 2025 policies place significant emphasis on data governance and security in the context of Al. M-25-21 encourages data reuse, interoperability, and active data quality management to support Al development and save taxpayer dollars. M-25-22 imposes strict requirements on protecting government data, particularly prohibiting the use of non-public data for training commercial models without consent and mandating clear contractual terms for data ownership and IP rights. The inherent risks associated with Al, including potential privacy violations through data inference or security breaches targeting sensitive training data, further amplify the need for robust data governance and security practices.<sup>15</sup>

                 <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                    This creates strong demand for consulting services focused on the intersection of data management, security, privacy, and Al. Offerings include developing agency-wide data governance policies tailored for Al; establishing data quality frameworks and remediation processes; designing secure data architectures that support Al workloads while enforcing access controls; implementing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to protect sensitive data used in Al training or inference; advising on data sharing agreements and strategies for leveraging open data resources; ensuring procurement contracts comply with M-25-22 data use and IP clauses; implementing secure Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipelines to manage the Al development lifecycle securely; and conducting specialized Al security assessments, vulnerability testing, and penetration testing to identify and mitigate Al-specific threats.<sup>95</sup>

                    Often, the biggest impediment to successful Al implementation within large organizations, including government agencies, is not the Al algorithms themselves but the challenges associated with accessing, preparing, and governing the necessary data.<sup>10</sup> Data often resides in silos, varies in quality, and is subject to complex usage restrictions. Consultants who can effectively address these foundational data challenges—spanning governance, quality, integration, security, and privacy—provide a critical enabling service for unlocking the value of Al.

                   The success of the government's Al ambitions hinges on having a workforce capable of developing, managing, overseeing, and effectively utilizing Al technologies. M-25-21 explicitly recognizes this by requiring agencies to include plans for building an "Al-ready federal workforce" in their Al strategies. This need is amplified by the broader national focus on Al talent development, as evidenced by the Al Education Executive Order<sup>34</sup> and related legislative proposals.<sup>60</sup> The general market also faces Al skills shortages<sup>25</sup>, making recruitment and retention competitive.

                 <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                    Effective workforce enablement requires more than just technical training for data scientists and engineers. It demands a multi-layered approach addressing the needs of various roles within an agency.<sup>12</sup> Leaders need training on the strategic implications of Al and how to foster an innovative culture. Managers require skills to oversee Al-augmented teams and processes. Procurement and legal staff need to understand Al risks and contracting requirements. End-users must be trained on how to interact with Al tools responsibly and effectively, including understanding their limitations and potential biases. Personnel involved in overseeing high-impact Al systems need specific training on their responsibilities and the tools required for effective monitoring and intervention.

                 <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                    This creates opportunities for consulting firms specializing in workforce transformation, training, and change management in the context of Al. Services include designing and delivering customized Al training curricula for different federal roles (from basic Al literacy to advanced technical skills to ethical considerations); conducting workshops and executive briefings; developing comprehensive Al talent strategies encompassing recruitment, upskilling, and retention; and implementing change management programs to address cultural resistance, build trust, and facilitate the adoption of Al-driven processes.<sup>10</sup> Firms can also explore opportunities to partner on initiatives stemming from the Al Education EO, such as developing K-12 resources or supporting apprenticeship programs.<sup>34</sup>
