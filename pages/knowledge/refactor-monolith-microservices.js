            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Step 1: Understand Your Monolith Deeply</h2>
            <p>
              Before attempting to break apart a monolith, a deep understanding of its current state is paramount. This isn't just about code; it involves understanding business processes, data flows, dependencies, and operational characteristics.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2"> {/* Adjusted list styling */}
              <li><strong>Document the Architecture:</strong> Create diagrams showing major components, databases, external integrations, and key data flows. Identify synchronous vs. asynchronous communication patterns.</li>
              <li><strong>Identify Business Capabilities & Domains:</strong> Map code modules or sections to specific business functions (e.g., user management, order processing, inventory lookup, reporting). This is crucial for defining potential microservice boundaries later.</li>
              <li><strong>Analyze Dependencies:</strong> Use code analysis tools and manual review to map dependencies between different parts of the monolith (e.g., shared libraries, direct function calls, shared database tables). Understand the coupling level.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Model Analysis:</strong> Examine the database schema. Identify tables primarily used by specific business capabilities versus those shared across many functions. Shared tables often represent significant challenges for decomposition.</li>
              <li><strong>Operational Assessment:</strong> Understand current deployment processes, monitoring practices, scaling bottlenecks, and failure modes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This thorough understanding forms the basis for identifying suitable candidates for extraction and planning the migration strategy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Step 2: Implement the Strangler Fig Pattern</h2>
            <p>
              The Strangler Fig pattern (named after strangler vines that grow around trees) is a popular and relatively safe approach for incremental refactoring. Instead of a risky "big bang" rewrite, you gradually replace pieces of the monolith with new microservices, routing traffic to the new service while the old functionality still exists as a fallback.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Introduce a Facade/Proxy:</strong> Place a routing layer (like an API Gateway, a dedicated reverse proxy like Nginx/Envoy, or even logic within the monolith's frontend) in front of the monolith. Initially, all traffic passes through to the existing monolith.</li>
              <li><strong>Identify & Extract a Candidate Service:</strong> Choose a relatively self-contained piece of functionality (often identified during the DDD assessment) to extract first. Build this as a new, independent microservice.</li>
              <li><strong>Intercept & Redirect Traffic:</strong> Modify the facade/proxy layer to intercept requests intended for the extracted functionality and route them to the new microservice instead of the monolith.</li>
              <li><strong>Iterate and Expand:</strong> Gradually identify, build, and redirect traffic for more functionalities, service by service. The new microservices "strangle" the old monolith over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Decommission the Monolith:</strong> Once all desired functionality has been extracted and traffic is fully routed to the new microservices, the original monolithic components can be safely decommissioned.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Strangler Fig pattern minimizes risk by allowing parallel operation and gradual rollout, enabling continuous delivery throughout the migration process without requiring significant downtime.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Step 3: Apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for Service Boundaries</h2>
            <p>
              Domain-Driven Design provides principles for modeling complex software based on the underlying business domain. It's invaluable for identifying logical, cohesive boundaries for your microservices.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Identify Bounded Contexts:</strong> Work with domain experts to identify Bounded Contexts â€“ specific areas within the business domain where a particular model and language apply (e.g., "Sales Context," "Shipping Context," "Inventory Context"). Each Bounded Context is a strong candidate for becoming one or more microservices.</li>
              <li><strong>Define Ubiquitous Language:</strong> Establish a common, unambiguous language shared by developers and domain experts within each Bounded Context.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Context Maps:</strong> Map the relationships between different Bounded Contexts (e.g., Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier, Anti-Corruption Layer). This helps define how microservices will need to interact.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on Cohesion:</strong> Ensure that functionality within a single microservice is highly cohesive (related to a single business capability).</li>
              <li><strong>Minimize Coupling:</strong> Design services to be loosely coupled, minimizing dependencies on the internal details of other services. Communication should happen via well-defined APIs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Applying DDD helps ensure that your microservices are aligned with business capabilities, leading to more maintainable, understandable, and independently evolvable services.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Step 4: Containerize and Orchestrate with Docker & Kubernetes</h2>
            <p>
              As you extract microservices, containerize them using Docker and orchestrate their deployment using Kubernetes.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Dockerize Each Microservice:</strong> Create a `Dockerfile` for each new microservice, packaging its code, runtime, and dependencies into a portable image. (Refer to previous article examples for Dockerfile structure).</li>
              <li><strong>Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:</strong> Deploy a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using managed services like EKS, AKS, GKE or on-premises).</li>
              <li><strong>Create Kubernetes Manifests:</strong> Define Kubernetes Deployments and Services for each microservice using YAML files (as shown in previous examples). Ensure you include health probes (liveness/readiness) and resource requests/limits.</li>
              <li><strong>Deploy via CI/CD:</strong> Implement separate CI/CD pipelines for each microservice to automate building, testing, pushing images, and deploying updates to Kubernetes independently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Kubernetes handles scaling, self-healing, service discovery, and load balancing, providing the necessary infrastructure foundation for a robust microservices architecture.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Step 5: Monitor and Manage the Distributed System</h2>
            <p>
              Microservices introduce distributed system complexities that require robust monitoring and management strategies:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Aggregate logs from all microservice containers into a central system (e.g., EFK stack - Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana; or Loki, Promtail, Grafana) for easier searching and analysis.</li>
              <li><strong>Distributed Tracing:</strong> Implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Tempo, OpenTelemetry) to track requests as they flow across multiple microservices, essential for debugging latency and errors in complex interactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Metrics Collection:</strong> Gather key performance indicators (KPIs) and resource metrics from each microservice and the underlying infrastructure using tools like Prometheus and visualize them with Grafana.</li>
              <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Rely on Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes for automated health monitoring and recovery.</li>
              <li><strong>Alerting:</strong> Set up alerts based on logs, traces, and metrics to proactively notify teams of issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Effective observability is non-negotiable for successfully operating a microservices architecture in production.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6 mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
